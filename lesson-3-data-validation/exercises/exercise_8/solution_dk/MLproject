    # NOTE: the -s flag is necessary, otherwise pytest will capture all the output and it
    # will not be uploaded to W&B. Hence, the log in W&B will be empty.
    command: >-
      pytest -s -v .
    # pytest -s -vv .
# -s:
#   Disables output capturing by pytest. This means that any output (e.g., print statements or logs) will be displayed directly in the terminal instead of being captured and hidden by pytest.
#   This is useful when you want to debug or see real-time output during test execution.
# -vv:
#   Increases verbosity to show detailed information about the tests being executed. 
#   It provides more information than -v, such as setup/teardown details and additional debugging output.
